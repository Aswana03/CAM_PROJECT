The SmartDispense:Automatic Kitchen Dispenser is a household appliance designed to streamline the storage and dispensing of essential kitchen ingredients such as rice, powders, and curry powders. The system operates through user input, where the desired ingredient is selected. The dispenser rotates to the specific angle corresponding to the selected container, ensuring the target item is accurately positioned. The system then prompts the user to input the required weight of the ingredient. Once the desired weight is entered, the dispenser automatically opens the container lid or shelter and dispenses the exact quantity requested. A built-in weight-sensing mechanism ensures precise dispensing, and the process halts immediately when the target weight is reached. The system then securely closes the lid, delivering the ingredient ready for use.
